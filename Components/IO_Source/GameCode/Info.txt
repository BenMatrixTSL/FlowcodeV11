Hi Ben,

I think I have all the needed macro's for the GameCode. You'll find the schematic, a front view of the device (maybe usefull when creating the component?) and the .fcfx file containing the macro's in attachment. For the DF-player operations I used your V9 macro's as inspiration :)

I don't think it is necessary to include functions like "ButtonsRead" or "VibratorWrite" and so on, because those are easier done using the basic input output commands. Feel free to give feedback on the macro's, or if you think I still need to include certain functions!

The ideal scenario for me would be the following:

    The GameCode target and component + macro's available in V8. This is important for schools already using V8. You said making GameDude a free target in V8 is not possible so a PIC8 chip pack is required, but this should not be an issue because all the schools I know of have the PIC8 chip pack.

    The GameCode as a free target and component + macro's available in V9. I'm not entirely sure how free targets work in V9, so correct me if I'm wrong, but this is how I see it at the moment.

    Users buy the GameCode, advertised as fully compatible with Flowcode. The manual guides them to the Flowcode download page where they download the latest FC version, register for a free licence (?) and get to work using the component macro's etc. They get their first programming experience using GameCode and Flowcode, and will hopefully be persuaded to use a more extensive paid version of Flowcode in the future ;)

Is the above scenario possible, and is this how you see it? Or would users still need to buy the "Basic IO" pack to for example use inputs, outputs and read ADC?


Extra info you might need for creating the target:

    The config word space is write protected, so this can be disabled in Flowcode.

    Clock speed is set at 16MHz.

    Codeoffset of 0x2000 is required.

    When connected to the PC and set to programming mode, the GameCode shows up as if its a usb thumb drive (name: GameCode V3). Is it possible to make Flowcode copy the hex-file to this location when pressing "compile to chip"?
