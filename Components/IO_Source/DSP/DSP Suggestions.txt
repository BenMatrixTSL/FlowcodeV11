What about a DSP Filter called Powerliner_remover

There is a notchefilter with different frequencies 50Hz, 100Hz, 150Hz,200Hz in one component
There is only one parameter for choosing 50Hz or 60Hz. mode.
So we can filter noise from powerliner with all harmonic waves in one go.



There is a tool from Mathlab to generate filter and there coefficients. In your DSP Filter Component, I have to insert these coefficients.
There are a lot of numbers. Is it possible for the new DSP Filter Component to insert the coefficients in a field for "all in one go "and not in a single field. Can I insert more as 12 coefficients?



If I have to use the filters individually, that's fine. I can then choose any filter with different parameters for each channel. A multiplexer and demultiplex would still be good. The current MUX is graphically a bit strange. It would be easier to have the entrances in one line and in my case it should have 10 entrances.

Of course, the CSV is a very good idea. In my mind there would also be a SCADA component, that sends the data to a computer running SCADA or other software. I can choose to use for sending the data (buffer) to UART; USB; Network communication; or a HTML page. And on the SCADA side, the receiver and demultiplexer for it. But that's just an idea



I see what you mean here, a bit of a lineariser, or delineariser with some kind of look up table of readings that are then interpolated between. It should be possible. I'll have a think on it :D
