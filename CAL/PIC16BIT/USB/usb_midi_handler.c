	// switch back to normal full power run mode conditions.  The host allows
	// 10+ milliseconds of wakeup time, after which the device must be
	// fully back to normal, and capable of receiving and processing USB
	// packets.  In order to do this, the USB module must receive proper
	// clocking (IE: 48MHz clock must be available to SIE for full speed USB
	// operation).
	// Make sure the selected oscillator settings are consistent with USB
    // operation before returning from this function.

	// Typically, user firmware does not need to do anything special
	// if a USB error occurs.  For example, if the host sends an OUT
	// packet to your device, but the packet gets corrupted (ex:
	// because of a bad connection, or the user unplugs the
	// USB cable during the transmission) this will typically set
	// one or more USB error interrupt flags.  Nothing specific
	// needs to be done however, since the SIE will automatically
	// send a "NAK" packet to the host.  In response to this, the
	// host will normally retry to send the packet again, and no
	// data loss occurs.  The system will typically recover
	// automatically, without the need for application firmware
	// intervention.

	// Nevertheless, this callback function is provided, such as
	// for debugging purposes.
